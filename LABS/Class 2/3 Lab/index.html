        Biography of Christopher Spooner
    </h1>
    <div>
    <p>
        Hi my name is Chris. I was born November 1, 2003 in New Orleans ,Louisiana. On my down time I enjoy cooking,
        playing video games, and watching anime. My favorite color is black. To help clear my mind at times I love
        listening to music. Growing up
        I've never stayed at the same school so within all 12 years of school I've been to 8 different schools. From
        freshman to sophommore year I went to East Ascension High School in Gonzales, Louisiana, then from junior to
        senior year I went to Olive Branch High School where I graduated from. Orignally I'm a graduate of 2022, but do
        to me having all my credits I graduted in December of '21. While in school I wasn't allowed to work ,so I can
        focus on school so I have no job experience. Going through school I wanted to be a famous chef at my own
        restraurant, but I figured if I turned something I love in to a job would I love it anymore? After finishing
        school I knew I had to do something, but I didn't know what I really wanted. Then one of my family member
        recommended this program to me called CodeCrew, because she knew I liked computers. Some goals I have in life
        are:
    <ul>
        <li>Owning my own restraurant/or being known fas a good chef</li>
        <li>Buying my dream car</li>
        <li>Not being a disappoinment to my people</li>
        <li>Getting out of my parents place and moving somewhere else</li>
        <li>Becoming a streamer/pro gamer</li>
        <li>Meeting a web of people that can help me, and that I can help in the future.</li>
        <li>Becoming a Software Developer</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
