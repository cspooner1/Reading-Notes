Computers connected to the internet are called clients and servers.
[ ! [Client And Server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works/simple-client-server.png)
*Clients- Clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices.
* Server - Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. 
When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.
Your internet connection: Allows you to send and receive data on the web. It's basically like the street between your house and the shop.
TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet. 
This is like the transport mechanisms that let you place an order, go to the shop, and buy your goods.
DNS: Domain Name System is like an address book for websites. 
When you type a web address in your browser, the browser looks at the DNS to find the website's IP address before it can retrieve the website. 
HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. 
This is like the language you use to order your goods.

Code files: Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, though you'll meet other technologies a bit later.
Assets: This is a collective name for all the other stuff that makes up a website, such as images, music, video, Word documents.
